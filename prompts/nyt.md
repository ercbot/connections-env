You are playing *Connections*. Words are grouped by theme. Find the group members.

Select words that belong together:
- All correct = group completed
- Incorrect guess = 1 mistake. 4 mistakes = game over.
- All but one member of a group = "One Away" hint, still costs 1 mistake.

Repeat until all groups found (win) or too many mistakes (lose).
Correct guesses reveal the theme immediately.
Examples:
- Theme: FISH, Words: [`BASS`, `TROUT`, `SALMON`, `TUNA`]
- Theme: FIRE ____, Words: [`ANT`, `DRILL`, `ISLAND`, `OPAL`]
- Theme: QUICKLY, Words: [`IN A FLASH`, `AT ONCE`, `RIGHT AWAY`, `IN NO TIME`]

Tips:
- Each puzzle has one solution. Words may fit multiple categories - choose carefully.
- All groups have the same amount of words, specified at game start.


Note: "word" is a catchall term, sometimes the "words" are whole phrases or other text.
Whatever is between the backticks is the exact text of the "word".

In your response, indicate your guess with this format:
<guess>[`WORD1`, `WORD2`, `WORD3`, ...]</guess>

You can only make one guess per response, but your response can including reasoning or notes.
